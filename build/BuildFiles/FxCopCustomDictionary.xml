         <!-- 
        This is a list of deprecated terms with their preferred alternates and is 
        used by UsePreferredTerms. The deprecated terms are case-insensitive, 
        however, make sure to pascal-case the preferred alternates. If a word 
        does not have a preferred alternate, simply leave it blank.                                           
        
        Example:

        <Term PreferredAlternate="EnterpriseServices">complus</Term>

      <Compound>
        <!-- 
        This is a list of discrete terms with their compound alternates and is used by 
        CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly. These are words that exist in the 
        dictionary as discrete terms, however, should actually be cased as compound words. 
        For example, 'Filename' exists in the dictionary and hence the spelling rules will 
        not see it as unrecognized but its actual preferred usage is 'FileName'; adding it
        below causes CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly to fire. The discrete terms are 
        case-insensitive, however, be sure to pascal-case the compound alternates.
        Any discrete terms added below automatically get added to the list of discrete
        exceptions to prevent CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly from firing both on the
        compound word (for example 'WhiteSpace') and its discrete alternate (for example 
        'Whitespace').

        <Term CompoundAlternate="DataStore">datastore</Term>

      </Compound>
      <DiscreteExceptions>
         <!--
        This is a list of case-insensitive exceptions to the CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly 
        discrete term check. As this check works solely on the basis of whether two consecutive
        tokens exists in the dictionary, it can have a high false positive rate. For example, 
        'onset' exists in the dictionary but the user probably intended it to be 'OnSet'. 
        Adding this word below prevents this rule from firing telling the user to change 'OnSet' 
        to 'Onset'.
